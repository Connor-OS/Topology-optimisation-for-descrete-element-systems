# Topology-optimisation-for-descrete-element-systems
This repository contains a simple topology optimisation code with discrete particles and interaction potentials. Writen in MATLAB.

topDEM.m contains a 150 line simple implementation.

topC.m contains an implementation that writes two dumpfiles it.txt containing information on itteration number, cost function, and timing and xy.txt containing xyz information as well as mass and strain information for used in post analysis software like ovito.
